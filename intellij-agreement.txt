4.6. The Developer hereby authorizes JetBrains to issue license certificates on behalf of the Developer for any Plugins sold through JetBrains Marketplace.

5. Your Remuneration for Paid Plugins
5.1. As Your remuneration for making a Paid Plugin available to Customers on JetBrains Marketplace and for making a Paid Plugin available via JetBrains Resellers (if applicable), JetBrains will pay You a Developer Fee for each Paid Plugin sold, unless You selected another formula or amount when uploading the Paid Plugin or at a later time (if such option is available) and unless agreed otherwise between the parties in writing.

5.2. The Developer Fee is:

(a) eighty-five percent (85%) of the List Price (excluding any taxes) for Paid Plugins sold on or after July 1, 2020; or

(b) an amount calculated as a percentage notified to You by JetBrains; such Developer Fee shall never be lower than seventy-five percent (75%) of the List Price (excluding any taxes) and shall apply exclusively to Paid Plugins sold after the date stated in the notification, which shall be at least one month after the date such notification is sent.

5.3. The Paid Plugin is sold when a Customer or, for Plugins sold via a JetBrains Reseller, a JetBrains Reseller makes a final payment to JetBrains for the Paid Plugin made available to them. Depending on the selected pricing model, this may be a one-off payment for the download, or payment for each subscription period, or other arrangement. Final payment means that the Customer, a JetBrains Reseller, a third party paying on either of their behalf, or the applicable financial institution fully settles the payment to JetBrains for the applicable download or other use of the Paid Plugin as determined by JetBrains. If JetBrains refunds a List Price or its portion to a Customer or to a JetBrains Reseller, subject to the refund scheme under the applicable terms of use or reseller agreement (which You permit JetBrains to set entirely in its own discretion without consulting You), You agree that You will not receive any Developer Fee on the refunded portion of the List Price.

5.4. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, up to thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month in which any Paid Plugin has been sold, JetBrains will provide You with a report detailing (a) sales of Paid Plugins and (b) the corresponding Developer Fee. All payments will be made in US dollars or euros, at JetBrains’ sole discretion, unless otherwise agreed with JetBrains. JetBrains will pay the Developer Fee within thirty (30) days from issuance of the invoice by JetBrains in accordance with Section 7 of this Agreement. You agree to provide JetBrains with, and promptly notify JetBrains of any change of, details of a valid bank account in Your name and a valid email address for the purposes of resolving any possible issues with payment processing.

5.5. JetBrains is entitled to accrue and withhold payments, without interest, until the total amount due to You (net of any tax withholding, as further described below) is at least USD 200.00 or EUR 200.00, depending on the relevant currency. Even if the amount due does not reach USD 200.00 or EUR 200.00, depending on the relevant currency as of December 31 of each calendar year, JetBrains will pay You the Developer Fee for Plugins sold until that date, and such payment shall be made within thirty (30) days of issuance of invoice by JetBrains in accordance with Section 7 of this Agreement. If JetBrains pays You a Developer Fee and later issues a refund or credit to a Customer, a JetBrains Reseller, or a third party paying on either of their behalf for such sale (or receives a chargeback related to the sale), JetBrains may offset the amount of the Developer Fee that JetBrains previously paid to You against a future Developer Fee or other amounts that would otherwise be payable to You under this Agreement, or require You to remit that amount to JetBrains. JetBrains may also withhold and offset sums You owe to JetBrains against amounts that are payable to You. You agree that any fees charged by Your bank in connection with wire transfers pursuant to this section are borne solely by You.

5.6. When this Agreement terminates, JetBrains may withhold all Developer Fees due for a period of sixty (60) days from the date they would otherwise be payable, in order to ensure JetBrains’ ability to offset refunds of any Customer, JetBrains Reseller, or third party paying on either of their behalf or make any other offsets to which JetBrains is entitled. Except for commissions charged by the recipient’s payment system, bank fees associated with payment of the Developer Fee are borne by JetBrains. JetBrains uses conversion rates set by the Czech National Bank for every relevant month.

5.7. In the event of obsolete, incorrect, or incomplete bank account details, You shall notify JetBrains without undue delay. If any part of the Developer Fee payment to You is unsuccessful and the amount of Developer Fee to be paid is not credited to Your account due to obsolete, incorrect, or incomplete bank account details, JetBrains will promptly inform You through the email address You provided in accordance with Section 5.4. of this Agreement. If You do not rectify the bank account details within 30 days of the dispatch of the notification, JetBrains shall notify You again through the aforementioned means or any other channels of contact You have provided to JetBrains, if appropriate. If after the lapse of additional sixty (60) days from the the dispatch of the second notification, the bank account details are not rectified, then as of this moment You will be deemed to have waived Your right to such payment in full (the Developer Fee) and the amount which was to be paid shall become property of JetBrains.

6. Taxes
6.1. You are solely responsible for any income tax or other taxes due and payable resulting from JetBrains’ payments of Developer Fees to You. JetBrains is a tax resident in the Czech Republic, a member state of the European Union. Unless otherwise stated, the amounts due to You hereunder are exclusive of any taxes that may apply to such payments. JetBrains maintains the right to deduct or withhold any applicable withholding taxes payable by You from amounts due from JetBrains, and the amounts due, as reduced by such deductions or withholdings, will constitute the full payment to You.

6.2. The VAT supply date within the year is the last date of each calendar month in which the total amount due is at least USD 200.00 or EUR 200.00, depending on the relevant currency. At year end, the supply date is always December 31 of each year even if the total amount due is below USD 200.00 or EUR 200.00, depending on the relevant currency.

6.3. You must provide JetBrains with any VAT-related information as requested via JetBrains Marketplace, and You must inform JetBrains of any changes to such information without undue delay.

7.3.

If the Marketplace Approval Guidelines are updated by JetBrains, You will ensure that all Your Content complies with the updated Marketplace Approval Guidelines within thirty (30) days of their publication.

You may not reverse-engineer, disassemble, or decompile any binary code used in connection with JetBrains Marketplace, including any software, JetBrains Product, APIs, documentation, and related materials ("JetBrains Content"), to which JetBrains provides You access.

If You post a review of a competitor’s Plugin for a JetBrains Product, You must disclose Your identity and the fact that You publish a competitive Plugin for a JetBrains Product.

You must not solicit ratings and reviews of Your Plugin in a manipulative way, for example, by incentivizing JetBrains Marketplace users to write a positive review in exchange for a discount or by offering a plugin for free in exchange for a five-star rating.

All reviews or other posts must comply with the JetBrains Marketplace Content Moderation Policy available at https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/terms/marketplace-content-moderation/, and JetBrains may, in its sole discretion, take down reviews or other posts or block reviewers if the JetBrains Marketplace Content Moderation Policy is violated or the obligations arising from this section are not fulfilled.

JetBrains may stop any transaction, or take other actions as needed to restrict access to or availability of any Content that does not comply with this Agreement or that otherwise might adversely affect end users. Inclusion of a Plugin on JetBrains Marketplace does not relieve You of responsibility to ensure that Your Plugin complies with this Agreement and any applicable laws and regulations.

17. Internal Complaint-Handling System
17.1. Any complaints shall be sent to the email address marketplace@jetbrains.com. All complaints are then handled through JetBrains' free of charge internal complaint system. The system allows Developers to lodge complaints especially regarding any of the following issues:

(a) alleged non-compliance by JetBrains with any legal regulation which affects the Developer lodging the complaint (the ‘complainant’);

(b) technological issues which relate directly to the provision of online intermediation services (this JetBrains Marketplace), and which affect the complainant;

(c) measure taken by, or behavior of, JetBrains which relates directly to the provision of the online intermediation services, and which affects the complainant.

17.2. JetBrains will duly consider complaints lodged and the follow-up which it may need to give to the complaint in order to adequately address the issue raised and process the complaint. Within five (5) business days after the delivery of the complaint, JetBrains will communicate to the complainant the outcome of the internal complaint-handling process.

17.3. If any complaint could not be resolved by means of the internal complaint-handling system referred to in this section 17, the complainant may use the mediation under section 18.

17.4. The mechanism described in this section is without prejudice to your right to report content according to Section 3 and object to our decisions pursuant to Section 5 of JetBrains Marketplace Content Moderation policy available at https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/terms/marketplace-content-moderation/.

18. Mediation

(a) listed mediators as per https://www.themii.ie/ or

(b) listed mediators according to Act No. 202/2012 Coll., Mediation Act, available at https://mediatori.justice.cz.

18.2. JetBrains shall bear a reasonable proportion of the total costs of mediation in each individual case. A reasonable proportion of those total costs shall be determined, on the basis of a suggestion by the mediator, by taking into account all relevant elements of the case at hand, in particular the relative merits of the claims of the parties to the dispute, the conduct of the parties, as well as the size and financial strength of the parties relative to one another.

18.3. Any attempt to reach an agreement through mediation on the settlement of a dispute in accordance with this section 18 shall not affect the rights of JetBrains and Developers concerned to initiate judicial proceedings at any time before, during or after the mediation process.

18.4. If requested by a Developer, before entering into or during mediation, JetBrains shall make available, to the Developer, information on the functioning and effectiveness of mediation related to its activities.

19. Term and Termination
19.1. The term of this Agreement ("Term") will begin on the date You indicate Your assent to the terms of this Agreement by checking the box (or similar action) to accept the Agreement that is presented to You, and will continue until You or JetBrains terminate it.

19.2. Either JetBrains or You may terminate this Agreement with a thirty (30) day advance written notice to the other party.

19.3. Either JetBrains or You may withdraw Your Plugin from JetBrains Marketplace.

19.4. Either JetBrains or You may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party (or with the notice specified by the terminating party at the time) if (a) the other party becomes the subject of a bankruptcy petition or other proceeding relating to insolvency, or (b) the other party breaches its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement, or infringes the terminating party’s intellectual property rights, or (c) the other party commits a breach of the Agreement including JetBrains Marketplace Approval Guidelines.

19.5.

19.8.

Unless otherwise specified by JetBrains: (a) all EULAs and associated end user licenses and subscriptions to Your Plugins will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement in accordance with their terms and (b) You will continue to host and operate any Paid Plugins hosted outside JetBrains Marketplace for use by end users at least until the conclusion of any paid terms or subscriptions of all Customers who have purchased such Paid Plugins.

You will also promptly make available to JetBrains, end users, and any other third party that is entitled to it, the source code corresponding to any Plugin or portion thereof if, and in the manner required by applicable third-party terms and conditions.

20.3. You confirm that You own all the Intellectual Property Rights related to Your Plugins necessary in order for You to provide Your Plugins to JetBrains for distribution on JetBrains Marketplace.

21.1. You will indemnify, defend, and hold JetBrains, its subsidiaries, respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, contractors and assigns harmless from and against any loss, claim, liability, demand, damage, action or cause of action (including reasonable attorney fees) arising out of any claim relating to:

If You do not promptly assume and conduct the defense of a Claim or take reasonable action to settle any such Claim after being provided with sufficient reasonable advance notice to evaluate the Claim, then JetBrains may take control of the defense (without limiting Your indemnification obligations). Your obligations under this Section are independent of Your other obligations under the Agreement.

If You are compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information, You must provide JetBrains with a prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at JetBrains’ cost, if JetBrains wishes to contest the disclosure.

22.3. JetBrains may develop, have already developed, or be developing its own products and services, and works with many other third parties. Either JetBrains or these third parties could in the future develop, be developing now, or have already developed products similar to Yours. However, JetBrains will in no event use any of Your intellectual property contained within any Content for such purposes.

22.4. You should not provide JetBrains with any information that You consider confidential. You agree that JetBrains is not subject to any confidentiality obligations or usage restrictions related to information that You may provide to Us in relation to this Agreement. You expressly agree that neither this Agreement nor Your participation in JetBrains Marketplace limits JetBrains’ right to develop or commission the development of products, concepts, systems, or techniques that are similar to or compete with any Plugin or any other products, concepts, systems, or techniques contemplated by or embodied in information You disclose to JetBrains. However, this section does not grant JetBrains any license under Your intellectual property rights.

FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS AGREEMENT, “JETBRAINS’ MARGIN” MEANS THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY JETBRAINS FROM SALES OF YOUR PLUGINS, MINUS THE DEVELOPER FEE JETBRAINS HAS PAID YOU.

25. Marketing
As long as this Agreement remains valid and is not terminated, the Developer is entitled to designate itself as a “JetBrains Technology Partner” for the purposes of using such designation in its own marketing and PR materials.

26. Agreement Changes
This Agreement, including its annexes, such as JetBrains Marketplace Approval Guidelines, relates to the broader JetBrains Marketplace, which will change over time. JetBrains reserves the right to change this Agreement at any time, in its sole discretion, with such changes to become effective on the date specified in the updated Agreement. If a revision meaningfully reduces Your rights, JetBrains will use reasonable efforts to notify You of the changes by emailing You at the email address You have provided or by displaying it in Your JetBrains Marketplace Account. You may be required to click through the updated Agreement to show Your acceptance. If You do not agree to any of the proposed changes, You may terminate this Agreement within thirty (30) days from the effective date of the updated Agreement by (i) providing a written notice to JetBrains and (ii) withdrawing all of Your Plugins from JetBrains Marketplace. If You so terminate the Agreement, the proposed changes will have no effect on You. However, if You do not so terminate the Agreement, then Your continued participation on and use of JetBrains Marketplace after thirty (30) days from the effective date constitute Your acceptance of the changes to the Agreement.

27. Dispute Resolution; Governing Law
Should the attempts to settle a dispute amicably fail, the dispute will be excluded from the jurisdiction of general courts and all such disputes will be finally decided by the Arbitration Court attached to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic by three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the Rules of that Arbitration Court, and the language of the proceedings will be English. However, if You are a consumer, any dispute between JetBrains and You which cannot be settled amicably will be resolved before the court where You have Your habitual residence, unless You choose to bring Your action before the court of the Czech Republic. Consumer complaints can also be addressed to the Czech Trade Inspection Authority (www.coi.cz), which is also competent for the out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes. Alternatively, consumers can select the European Commission’s online platform for dispute resolution (https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr).

28. General
28.1. This Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by both parties or as provided in the Sections 3 and 24.

28.2. Nothing in this Agreement constitutes any form of legal partnership between You and JetBrains, nor entitles You to present Yourself as a representative of JetBrains or its Affiliates.

28.3. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by a court with jurisdiction over the parties to this Agreement, such provision will be deemed to be restated to reflect as closely as possible the original intentions of the parties in accordance with applicable law, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

28.4. JetBrains’ failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of JetBrains’ rights to subsequently enforce the provision.

28.5. JetBrains may freely assign, transfer, and delegate its rights and obligations under this Agreement.

28.6. You agree that JetBrains may identify You as a Customer and/or Developer using JetBrains Marketplace and may refer to You by name, trade name, and trademark, if applicable. JetBrains may also make reference to Your business in JetBrains marketing materials, on JetBrains websites, and/or in public or legal documents. You hereby grant JetBrains a worldwide, non-exclusive, and royalty-free license to use Your name and any of Your trade names and trademarks solely pursuant to this section.

28.7. You acknowledge and agree that JetBrains Affiliates, JetBrains’ contractors, and JetBrains’ service providers may exercise all rights of JetBrains under this Agreement, including JetBrains’ license rights.

28.8. You may not assign any of Your rights or obligations under this Agreement without JetBrains’ prior written consent.

28.9. Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be made in writing and given (i) by JetBrains to You via the email address You have registered for Your JetBrains Marketplace Account or directly via JetBrains Marketplace, and (ii) by You via email to marketplace@jetbrains.com or to such other email or physical addresses as JetBrains may specify from time to time.
